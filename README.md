# Dafny extension for zed

Uses `dafny` as a language server (some features are not supported as they require LSP extensions)

Syntax highlighting is bare bones, I just wrote `highlights.scm` to support stuff I use, if you can add a better one
it's always encouraged. The tree-sitter grammar is also not the best, but I couldn't find a better one
